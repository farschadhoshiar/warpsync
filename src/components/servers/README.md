/**
 * Test Connection Feature Enhancement
 * 
 * This implementation adds comprehensive visual feedback for SSH connection testing:
 * 
 * 1. Enhanced useServers Hook:
 *    - Tracks connection status per server (connected, disconnected, testing, error, never-tested)
 *    - Stores last test results and timestamps
 *    - Updates status during testing process
 * 
 * 2. Visual Feedback Components:
 *    - ConnectionStatusBadge: Shows current connection status with icons and colors
 *    - Loading states during testing with spinners
 *    - Rich toast notifications with detailed information
 * 
 * 3. Enhanced Server List:
 *    - Connection status badges for each server
 *    - Quick test buttons with loading states
 *    - Detailed error messages and retry actions
 * 
 * 4. Enhanced Server Form:
 *    - Improved test connection with detailed feedback
 *    - Shows connection details (duration, server info, home directory)
 *    - Retry functionality on failures
 * 
 * 5. Toast Notifications:
 *    - Loading toasts during testing
 *    - Success toasts with connection details and action buttons
 *    - Error toasts with retry actions
 *    - Detail modals showing server information
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - The connection status is automatically tracked when servers are loaded
 * - Test buttons show loading state during testing
 * - Status badges update automatically based on test results
 * - Failed connections show detailed error messages with retry options
 * - Successful connections show timing and server details
 * 
 * Technical Implementation:
 * - Uses React state management for connection status tracking
 * - Integrates with existing SSH connection testing API
 * - Maintains backward compatibility with existing server management
 * - Provides TypeScript interfaces for type safety
